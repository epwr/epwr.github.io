<h2>About</h2>

Describing myself is always a challenge. I'm motivated by learning new things, creating a positive change in society, and solving complex problems.
I believe strongly in servant leadership. I have high standards for the work I produce, and crave critical feedback.

I believe the three big problems our society will face in the next 30 years are climate change, weak democratic institutions, and economic disruption
from advanced technology.

I want to work as directly as possible on solving these problems. For the last few years, I have been working on climate change by developing an automated
solution to deliver building decarbonization plans for commercial real estate. The technical, economic, and policy problems that surround a net-zero world
are complicated, important, and therefore fascinating.

Finally, I am a backend software engineer who wishes I was Buckminster Fuller just so I could claim having predicted [ephemeralization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeralization)
in 1938. We can't yet do everything with nothing, but software gets us pretty darn close.
