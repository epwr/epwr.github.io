<h2>About</h2>

I am a backend softare engineer with a passion for understanding techonolgy, a dedication to servant leadership, a deep seated curiosity,
and strong opinions about the power of incentives.

I believe the three biggest problems our global society will face in the next 30 years are climate change, weak democratic institutions,
and economic disruption from advanced technology. Addressing these challenges is the most important thing I can do with my career, and
is where I want to focus.

Currently, I work on mitigating climate change by developing systems to help drive emmision-reducing retrofits in commercial real estate.
[27% of worldwide emissions](https://globalabc.org/index.php/resources/publications/iea-tracking-report-buildings) come from the scope 2
emissions of buildings, and reducing these requires solutions that merge technology, economics, and policy.
